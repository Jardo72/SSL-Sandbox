## Failed Handshake Due To Absence of Client Certificate
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when client authentication is required, but the client has no certificate. The configurations for the client and server are virtually identical as the set of enabled protocol versions as well as the set of enabled cipher suites is equal for both. In addition, client authentication is requested by the server, and it is enabled for the client. The client's key-store is empty, it does not contain any certificate. After receiving the usual sequence of handshake messages from the server, the client responds with *Certificate* and *ClientKeyExchange* messages. However, the *Certificate* message does not carry any certificate. After receiving the above mentioned pair of handshake messages from the client, the server aborts the handshake with fatal *Alert*. The description seems to depend on the SSL/TLS implementation used by server - *bad_certificate* and *certificate_unknown* are the most likely descriptions.
