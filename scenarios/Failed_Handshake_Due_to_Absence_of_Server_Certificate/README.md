## Failed Handshake Due to Absence of Server Certificate
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when the server has no certificate. The configurations for the client and server are virtually identical as the set of enabled protocol versions as well as the set of enabled cipher suites is equal for both. In addition, client authentication is not requested by the server, and it is disabled for the client. The server's key-store is empty, it does not contain any certificate. After receiving the initial *ClientHello* message from the client, the server aborts the handshake with fatal *Alert* (*handshake_failure* is used as description).

There are actually two server configurations for this scenario - one using the default JSSE provider, the other using Bouncy Castle provider. Correspondingly, there are two capture files, each based on one of the above mentioned server configurations. As I used Oracle Java when performing the captures, the default JSSE provider was the Sun provider in my case. Both providers behave exactly the same way, i.e. the handshake is aborted the same way in both capture files.
