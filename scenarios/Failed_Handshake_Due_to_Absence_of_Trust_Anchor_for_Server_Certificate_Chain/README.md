## Failed Handshake Due To Absence of Trust Anchor for Server Certificate
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when the trust anchor for the server certificate is absent. The configurations for the client and server are virtually identical as the set of enabled protocol versions as well as the set of enabled cipher suites is equal for both. In addition, client authentication is not requested by the server, and it is disabled for the client. The certificate chain for the only certificate present in server's key-store does not involve any root CA certificate, it only involves the server certificate and the certificate of the intermediate CA that issued the server certificate. The client's trust-store also does not contain the certificate of the root CA that issued the certificate of the above mentioned intermediate CA. After receiving the *ClientHello* message from the client, the server responds with its usual sequence of handshake messages, including the *Certificate* message. The *Certificate* message does not carry any root CA certificate. After receiving the sequence of handshake messages from the server, the client fails to validate the server certificate chain and aborts the handshake with fatal *Alert*. The description seems to depend on the SSL/TLS implementation used by client - *bad_certificate* and *certificate_unknown* are the most likely descriptions.
