## Failed Handshake Due To Expired Client Certificate
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when client authentication is required, but the client certificate is expired. The configurations for the client and server are compatible as TLSv1.2 is enabled for both, and a quartet of cipher suites is enabled for both end-points. In addition, client authentication is requested by the server, and it is enabled for the client. The only certificate present in client's key-store is expired. After receiving the usual sequence of handshake messages from the server, the client responds with *Certificate* and *ClientKeyExchange* messages. After receiving the above mentioned pair of handshake messages from the client, the server fails to validate the client certificate and aborts the handshake with fatal *Alert*. The description seems to depend on the SSL/TLS implementation used by the server - *certificate_expired*, *bad_certificate* and *certificate_unknown* are the most likely descriptions.
