## Failed Handshake Due to Absence of Common Protocol Version
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when there is no common protocol version enabled for both end-points. For the client, only TLSv1.2 is enabled. However, this is not compatible with the server configuration which only enables TLSv1.1. The *ClientHello* message always carry only one protocol version, namely the highest protocol version enabled for the client. Therefore, when the server receives the *ClientHello* message, it has no idea whether the client supports other protocol version(s). Therefore, the server responds with the *ServerHello* message carrying TLSv1.1, hoping that this will be acceptable for the client. When the client receives the *ServerHello* message, it sees that there is no common protocol version, so it aborts the handshake with fatal alert (*handshake_failure* is used as description).
