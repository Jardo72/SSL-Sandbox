## Failed Handshake Due to Absence of Common Cipher Suite
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when there is a common protocol version but no common cipher suite enabled for both end-points. There is a common protocol version as TLSv1.2 is enabled for both client and server. For the client, only *TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256...* cipher suites are enabled. However, this is not compatible with the server configuration which only enables *TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128...* cipher suites. The *ClientHello* message carries all cipher suites enabled for the client. When the server receives the *ClientHello* message, it is clear that there is no chance to establish a session, so the server aborts the handshake with fatal alert (*handshake_failure* is used as description). Compare this scenario with the [scenario illustrating absence of common protocol version](../Failed_Handshake_Due_to_Absence_of_Common_Protocol_Version).
