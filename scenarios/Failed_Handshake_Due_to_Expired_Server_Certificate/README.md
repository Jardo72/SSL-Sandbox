## Failed Handshake Due To Expired Server Certificate
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when the server certificate is expired. The configurations for the client and server are virtually identical as the set of enabled protocol versions as well as the set of enabled cipher suites is equal for both. In addition, client authentication is not requested by the server, and it is disabled for the client. The only certificate present in server's key-store is expired. After receiving the *ClientHello* message from the client, the server responds with its usual sequence of handshake messages, including the *Certificate* message. After receiving the sequence of handshake messages from the server, the validation of the server certificate fails, and the client aborts the handshake with fatal *Alert*. The description seems to depend on the SSL/TLS implementation used by client - *certificate_expired*, *bad_certificate* and *certificate_unknown* are the most likely descriptions.
