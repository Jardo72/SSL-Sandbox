## Failed Handshake Due to Broken Server Certificate Chain
This scenario illustrates how the handshake is aborted when the server certificate chain is broken. The configurations for the client and server are virtually identical as the set of enabled protocol versions as well as the set of enabled cipher suites is equal for both. In addition, client authentication is not requested by the server, and it is disabled for the client. The only certificate present in server's key-store has truncated certificate chain without any CA certificate. After receiving the *ClientHello* message from the client, the server responds with its usual sequence of handshake messages, including the *Certificate* message. The server sends only its own end-entity certificate without any CA certificate to the client. The client has the root CA certificate comprising the trust anchor in its trust-store. However, the certificate of the intermediate CA which issued the server certificate is not available, so the certificate chain is incomplete and thus cannot be validated. After receiving the sequence of handshake messages from the server, the client aborts the handshake with fatal *Alert*. The description seems to depend on the SSL/TLS implementation used by the client - *bad_certificate* and *certificate_unknown* are the most likely descriptions.
